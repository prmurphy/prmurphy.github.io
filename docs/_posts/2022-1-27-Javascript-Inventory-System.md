I finished up the Harvard CS-50 class in July of 2020. Overall I would say it was a great indroductory class to the study of computer science. For the final project 
I made a simple inventory system in javascript using a nice little engine called Pixelbox: https://pixwlk.itch.io/pixelbox
You can play it here https://prmurphy.itch.io/simple-inventory-system
